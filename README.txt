The utilized datasets in the paper named “Agent Evaluation in Deployment of Multi-SUAVs for Communication Recovery”.

The following files are used in the experiments:
1. File “Jiuzhaigou_partial_elevation_data.xlsx” records the Jiuzhaigou’s partial elevation data obtained in Ref. [12].
2. File “A_real_world_scenario.xlsx” records the dataset utilized in the real-world scenario in this paper.
3. File “Sparse_data_set.xlsx” records the original sparse dataset used in the experiment section of this paper. This file is obtained from Ref. [13].
4. File “Dense_data_set.xlsx” records the original dense dataset used in the experiment section of this paper. This file is also obtained from Ref. [13].
5. File “Equation_8.py” is a program to generate a randomly distributed larger scale of the calibration point sets, i.e., Equation (8) in this paper. This file is designed by ourselves.

Note that file “A_real_world_scenario.xlsx” is applied in the real-world problem in Section III, and files “Sparse_data_set.xlsx”, “Dense_data_set.xlsx”, and “Equation_8.py” are used as the original datasets in large-scale experiments in Section VII.
